-- SQL User Logins
-- Your table: maintable_OMJJR
-- MySQL version: 8.0.23
-- In this MySQL challenge, 
-- the table provided shows all new users signing up on a specific date in 
-- the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
-- Your query should output the change from one month to the next. 
-- Because the first month has no preceding month, 
-- your output should skip that row. 
-- Your output should look like the following table.

-- | Month      | MonthToMonthChange |
-- | February   |                 -1 |
-- | March      |                  6 |
-- | April      |                 -6 |
-- | May        |                  4 |

-- Hereâ€™s the SQL query to solve the SQL User Logins challenge from the image:

SELECT 
	DATE_FORMAT(DateJoined,"%M") AS Month,
    COUNT(ID) -
    (
        SELECT COUNT(`m2`.ID) AS preCount FROM `maintable_omjjr` AS `m2`
		WHERE MONTH(`m2`.DateJoined) = MONTH(`m1`.DateJoined) - 1
    ) as MonthToMonthChange
FROM `maintable_omjjr` AS `m1`
WHERE MONTH(`m1`.DateJoined) != 1 GROUP BY Month ORDER BY DateJoined;


-- sql
-- SELECT 
--   DATE_FORMAT(current.month_date, '%M') AS Month,
--   (current.user_count - previous.user_count) AS MonthToMonthChange
-- FROM (
--   SELECT 
--     DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
--     MIN(date) AS month_date,
--     COUNT(*) AS user_count
--   FROM maintable_YKJ8N
--   GROUP BY month
-- ) current
-- JOIN (
--   SELECT 
--     DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
--     COUNT(*) AS user_count
--   FROM maintable_YKJ8N
--   GROUP BY month
-- ) previous
-- ON DATE_FORMAT(current.month_date, '%Y-%m') = 
--    DATE_FORMAT(DATE_ADD(previous.month, INTERVAL 1 MONTH), '%Y-%m');


-- Explanation:
-- - We group the users by month and count signups.
-- - Use a self-join to compare the current month with the previous month.
-- - The result shows the month name and the change in user count from the previous month.
